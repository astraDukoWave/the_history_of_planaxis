<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- WHY: DOCTYPE tells the browser to use modern HTML5 standards. Without it, 
     browsers enter "quirks mode" where they try to be compatible with very old 
     websites, causing inconsistent behavior.
     
     HOW: <!DOCTYPE html> is the simplest, most modern doctype declaration.
     
     RESULT: The browser renders the page using current web standards. -->

<html lang="en">
<!-- WHY: The lang attribute tells browsers and screen readers what language the
     content is in. This is crucial for accessibility (screen readers pronounce
     words correctly) and SEO (search engines understand the content language).
     
     HOW: lang="en" declares English as the primary language.
     
     RESULT: Better accessibility and search engine optimization. -->

<head>
  <!-- WHY: The <meta charset> declaration must come first in the head to ensure
       the browser correctly interprets special characters (é, ñ, 中, etc.) before
       reading any other content.
       
       HOW: UTF-8 is the universal character encoding that supports all languages
       and symbols. It's the web standard.
       
       RESULT: Text displays correctly regardless of language or special characters. -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  
  <!-- WHY: The viewport meta tag is critical for responsive design. Without it,
       mobile browsers render the page at desktop width (usually ~980px) and zoom
       out, making everything tiny.
       
       HOW: width=device-width tells the browser to use the actual device width
       (e.g., 375px on iPhone) instead of pretending to be desktop width. 
       initial-scale=1.0 prevents automatic zooming.
       
       RESULT: The page renders at the correct size on mobile devices, making our
       responsive CSS work properly. -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  
  <!-- WHY: The title appears in browser tabs, bookmarks, and search results. It's
       the first thing users see and is crucial for SEO.
       
       HOW: We use a descriptive, branded title that clearly identifies the page.
       
       RESULT: Clear identification in tabs and better search engine visibility. -->
  <title>Tomorrowland 2018: The Story of Planaxis | Enter the Deep Ocean Kingdom</title>
  
  <!-- WHY: Meta description appears in search results below the title. It's the
       first impression users get of your site and affects click-through rates.
       
       HOW: We write a compelling 150-160 character summary of the page content.
       
       RESULT: Better search result appearance and higher click-through rates. -->
  <meta name="description" content="Dive into the mystical underwater kingdom of Planaxis. Discover the legend of the golden seahorses and experience Tomorrowland 2018's most immersive story yet.">
  
  <!-- WHY: These meta tags control how the page appears when shared on social media
       (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.). Without them, social platforms show
       generic, ugly previews.
       
       HOW: Open Graph (og:) tags are recognized by most social platforms. We define
       the title, description, image, and URL.
       
       RESULT: Beautiful, engaging previews when the page is shared on social media. -->

  <!-- WHY: The theme-color meta tag colors the browser UI (address bar, status bar)
       on mobile devices to match your site's design, creating a seamless experience.
       
       HOW: We use our primary background color (deep ocean blue-black).

  <meta name="theme-color" content="#050a14">
  
  <!-- WHY: CSS files are loaded in a specific order because later styles override
       earlier ones (the "cascade" in Cascading Style Sheets). We load foundational
       styles first, then specific component styles.
       
       HOW: Each <link> tag loads a CSS file. rel="stylesheet" tells the browser
       it's CSS, not an icon or other resource type.
       
       RESULT: Styles apply in the correct order, with specific styles overriding
       general ones as intended. -->
  
  <!-- WHY: reset.css must load first to normalize browser defaults before we apply
       any custom styles. If it loads later, it might override our intentional styles.
       
       HOW: Simple link tag pointing to the file.
       
       RESULT: Clean slate for all browsers before applying custom styles. -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/reset.css">
  
  <!-- WHY: variables.css defines our design tokens (colors, spacing, fonts). It
       loads second so all subsequent stylesheets can use these variables.
       
       HOW: CSS custom properties (variables) become available once this file loads.
       
       RESULT: Consistent design system across all stylesheets. -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/variables.css">
  
  <!-- WHY: layout.css establishes the structural foundation (grid, flexbox, utilities).
       It loads before component styles so components can build on this foundation.
       
       HOW: Layout utilities become available for use.
       
       RESULT: Solid structural foundation for all components. -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/layout.css">
  
  <!-- WHY: Component-specific stylesheets (header, hero, sidebar) load next. The
       order doesn't matter much here since they style different elements.
       
       HOW: Each file targets specific components.
       
       RESULT: Modular, maintainable CSS where each file has a clear purpose. -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/header.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/hero.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/sidebar.css">
  
  <!-- WHY: responsive.css loads last so its media queries can override any previous
       styles at specific breakpoints. If it loaded earlier, other styles might
       override the responsive adjustments.
       
       HOW: Media queries in this file have the final say on layout at each breakpoint.
       
       RESULT: Responsive adjustments work correctly across all screen sizes. -->

       external domains we'll use later (like Google Fonts, CDNs). This reduces
       latency when we actually request resources from those domains.
       
       HOW: rel="preconnect" establishes a connection before resources are requested.

  <!-- WHY: The <header> element is a semantic HTML5 tag that identifies the main
       navigation area. Search engines and screen readers recognize this as the
       primary navigation, improving SEO and accessibility.
       
       HOW: Semantic tags replace generic <div> elements with meaningful names.
       
       RESULT: Better structured HTML that's easier to understand for both humans
       and machines (search engines, screen readers). -->
  <header class="main-header">
    <!-- WHY: The <nav> element specifically identifies navigation links. Screen
         readers announce "navigation" when entering this section, helping users
         orient themselves.
         
         HOW: Any group of navigation links should be wrapped in <nav>.
         
         RESULT: Enhanced accessibility for screen reader users. -->
    <nav>
      <!-- WHY: The logo should be a link to the homepage, following web conventions.
           When users click a logo, they expect to return to the home page.
           
           HOW: We wrap the logo text in an <a> tag with href pointing to the root.
           
           RESULT: Intuitive navigation that matches user expectations. -->
      <a href="/" class="logo" aria-label="Tomorrowland Planaxis Home">
        <!-- WHY: The logo text is wrapped in a span for styling flexibility. We might
             want to style "Planaxis" differently from "Tomorrowland" later.
             
             HOW: Spans are inline containers that don't affect layout but allow styling.
             
             RESULT: Flexible logo styling options. -->

      <!-- WHY: The hamburger button is hidden on desktop but appears on mobile to
           toggle the navigation menu. It needs an aria-label for accessibility since
           the icon alone doesn't describe its purpose to screen readers.
           
           HOW: Button with aria-label and aria-expanded to communicate state to
           assistive technology. The class is styled in responsive.css.
           
           RESULT: Accessible mobile menu toggle that works for all users. -->
      <button class="mobile-menu-toggle" aria-label="Toggle navigation menu" aria-expanded="false">
        <!-- WHY: We use simple span elements to create the hamburger icon (three lines)

             and easier to animate.
             
             HOW: Three horizontal spans styled with CSS to look like stacked lines.

           navigation links. Screen readers announce "list, 4 items" to help users
           understand the structure.
           
           HOW: Each link is an <li> (list item) containing an <a> (anchor/link).

               HOW: Add aria-current="page" to the active/current page link.

       is a distinct section with its own purpose (introducing the site), so it deserves
       its own semantic tag.
       
       HOW: Section with descriptive class and inline background image.
       
       RESULT: Clear document structure with semantic meaning. -->
  <section class="hero" style="background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, #0a1e3c 0%, #050a14 100%);">
    <!-- WHY: We use a gradient as a placeholder instead of a solid color to make the
         hero more visually interesting until a real image is added.
         
         HOW: CSS linear-gradient creates a smooth color transition from blue to black.
         
         RESULT: Attractive placeholder that suggests ocean depths. -->
    
    <!-- WHY: The hero-content div wraps all the text and buttons, allowing us to
         control their layout as a group (centering, max-width, etc.).

         RESULT: Easy-to-center, easy-to-constrain content group. -->
    <div class="hero-content">
      <!-- WHY: The <h1> is the most important heading on the page. There should only
           be ONE <h1> per page, and it should describe the main content. Search engines
           use this as the primary indicator of page topic.
           
           HOW: h1 with descriptive text that includes key terms (Tomorrowland, Planaxis).

      <h1 class="hero-title">The Story of Planaxis</h1>
      
      <!-- WHY: The <p> tag represents a paragraph of text. Using it (instead of a div)
           adds semantic meaning - this is a text paragraph, not just a container.
           
           HOW: Simple paragraph with class for styling.
           
           RESULT: Semantic HTML that communicates intent. -->

      <!-- WHY: Call-to-action buttons should be <a> tags (not <button>) if they navigate
           to another page. Buttons are for in-page actions (submit forms, toggle menus),
           links are for navigation. This is important for keyboard users and screen readers.
           
           HOW: We use an anchor tag styled to look like a button.
           
           RESULT: Proper semantics that work correctly with browser navigation and
           accessibility tools. -->

         visual and doesn't add meaningful content.
         
         HOW: aria-hidden removes the element from the accessibility tree.
         
         RESULT: Screen readers don't announce the decorative icon, reducing clutter. -->
    <div class="scroll-indicator" aria-hidden="true">
      <!-- WHY: We use a simple Unicode character (↓) for the scroll arrow rather than
           an image or icon font. This loads instantly with no HTTP request.
           
           HOW: HTML entity or Unicode character for down arrow.

       main content (sidebar navigation, related links, ads). Using it helps screen

       HOW: Aside with class for styling.
       
       RESULT: Semantic structure that helps assistive technology navigate the page. -->
  <aside class="utility-sidebar" aria-label="Quick navigation">
    <!-- WHY: The aria-label describes the purpose of this navigation section for screen
         reader users, since there are multiple navigation areas on the page (header
         and sidebar).
         
         HOW: Descriptive label that distinguishes this nav from the main header nav.

       It's positioned as a floating action button in the bottom-right corner.
       
       HOW: Button with aria-label for accessibility and aria-expanded to indicate state.

       HOW: Main tag wrapping the primary content sections.

  <!-- WHY: JavaScript goes at the end of the body (not in the head) so the entire
       HTML structure loads and renders before scripts execute. This improves perceived
       performance - users see content faster.
       
       HOW: Script tags just before the closing </body> tag.
       
       RESULT: Faster initial page render and better user experience. -->

    // WHY: We need JavaScript to handle mobile menu toggling and sidebar toggling on
    // small screens. Pure CSS can't detect clicks and add/remove classes dynamically.
    //
    // HOW: Event listeners detect clicks on toggle buttons and add/remove the "show"
    // class, which is styled in responsive.css to show/hide elements.
    //
    // RESULT: Interactive mobile menu and sidebar that work smoothly on all devices.
    
    // WHY: We use addEventListener instead of inline onclick attributes because it
    // separates behavior (JavaScript) from structure (HTML), following best practices
    // and making code more maintainable.
    //
    // HOW: Select elements with querySelector and attach event listeners.
    //

    // the HTML structure changes or elements are missing.

        // is cleaner than checking the current state and using add/remove separately.
        //
        // HOW: classList.toggle('show') handles the class management.
        //
        // RESULT: Simple, reliable toggle behavior.
        navLinks.classList.toggle('show');
        
        // WHY: aria-expanded tells screen readers whether the menu is open or closed.
        // We must keep this in sync with the visual state for accessibility.
        //
        // HOW: Check if the menu has the 'show' class and set aria-expanded accordingly.
        //
        // RESULT: Screen readers announce the correct menu state.

    // WHY: On scroll, we add a "scrolled" class to the header so it can change
    // appearance (add background, shadow) for better readability over content.

    // RESULT: Header that adapts to scrolling for optimal readability.
    window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {
      const header = document.querySelector('.main-header');
      
      // WHY: 50px is a threshold - after scrolling 50 pixels down, we consider the
      // user to have "scrolled" and trigger the header style change.
      //
