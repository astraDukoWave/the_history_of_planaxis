/* ============================================================================
   HEADER.CSS - Transparent Navigation Overlay
   
   WHY: Modern websites often feature transparent navigation that overlays the
   hero image, creating an immersive, edge-to-edge design. This eliminates the
   traditional white bar at the top and makes the hero section more impactful.
   
   HOW: We use position: absolute to remove the header from the normal document
   flow and layer it on top of the hero section with z-index.
   
   RESULT: A floating navigation bar that blends seamlessly with the hero image
   while remaining visible and functional.
   ============================================================================ */

/* WHY: The main-header class defines our primary navigation bar. position: absolute
   is crucial because it allows the header to overlay the hero section instead of
   pushing it down.
   
   HOW: top: 0 positions it at the very top of the page, and width: 100% makes it
   span the entire viewport. left: 0 ensures it starts from the leftmost edge.
   
   RESULT: The header floats above the hero image, starting from the top edge with
   no gap. */
.main-header {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  /* WHY: z-index: 1000 ensures the header stays on top of all other content. Without
     this, the hero image or other sections might overlap and hide the navigation.
     
     HOW: We use the value from our variables (--z-header) to maintain consistency
     across the entire stacking context system.
     
     RESULT: Navigation is always clickable and visible, never hidden behind content. */
  z-index: var(--z-header);
  
  /* WHY: Adding vertical padding creates space above and below the navigation links,
     making them easier to click (larger touch target) and visually balanced.
     
     HOW: --spacing-md gives us 24px of padding top and bottom. This creates a
     comfortable click area without making the header too tall.
     
     RESULT: A header that's easy to use on both desktop (mouse) and mobile (touch). */
  padding-top: var(--spacing-md);
  padding-bottom: var(--spacing-md);
  
  /* WHY: Transitions make the header smoothly adapt when we add effects on scroll
     (like changing background color or adding shadow when the user scrolls down).
     
     HOW: We're setting up the transition here even though the scroll effect isn't
     implemented yet. This is forward-thinking design.
     
     RESULT: When scroll effects are added later, they'll animate smoothly instead
     of jumping abruptly. */
  transition: background-color var(--transition-normal) var(--easing-default),
              box-shadow var(--transition-normal) var(--easing-default);
}

/* WHY: When users scroll down, we want the header to gain a background color for
   readability. The .scrolled class (added via JavaScript) triggers this change.
   
   HOW: The background uses our secondary blue with 95% opacity (rgba alpha channel),
   creating a semi-transparent backdrop that hints at content behind it.
   
   RESULT: The header becomes more visible against varied content while maintaining
   a subtle transparency effect. */
.main-header.scrolled {
  background-color: rgba(10, 30, 60, 0.95);
  /* WHY: A subtle shadow helps separate the header from content below it, adding
     depth to the design.
     
     HOW: box-shadow creates a soft black shadow (rgba 0,0,0) with 10% opacity
     that extends 10px down and blurs over 30px for a gradual fade.
     
     RESULT: The header appears to "float" above the page content. */

}

/* WHY: The nav element contains all navigation links. We need to distribute space
   between the logo (left) and menu (right) while keeping everything vertically centered.
   
   HOW: Flexbox with justify-content: space-between pushes the first child (logo)
   to the left and the last child (nav links) to the right, with maximum space between.
   
   RESULT: Classic header layout with logo on left, menu on right, automatically
   responsive to content size. */
.main-header nav {
  display: flex;

  /* WHY: We constrain the navigation to a max-width and center it so that on very
     wide screens (like 4K monitors), the nav doesn't stretch uncomfortably.
     
     HOW: max-width uses our standard container width (1200px), and margin: 0 auto
     centers it horizontally. Padding prevents edge-touching on smaller screens.
     
     RESULT: The navigation stays readable and well-proportioned on all screen sizes. */

/* WHY: The logo needs to be visually prominent and clickable. We style it as a
   text element rather than an image for flexibility and fast loading.
   
   HOW: Larger font size (--font-size-lg = 24px) and bold weight (700) make it stand
   out. The gold color connects to the Planaxis theme.
   
   RESULT: A clear, recognizable brand identifier that's immediately visible. */

  /* WHY: Letter-spacing (tracking) adds space between letters, creating an elegant,
     luxurious feel. It's commonly used in high-end branding.

  /* WHY: Adding a transition allows the logo to smoothly change color on hover,

   in the deep ocean. */

/* WHY: Navigation links need to be horizontal (side-by-side) rather than stacked.
   By default, <ul> is a block element with bullets.
