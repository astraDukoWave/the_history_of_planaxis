   WHY: Websites must work on devices of all sizes - from 320px phones to 4K
   monitors. A mobile-first approach means we style for phones first, then
   progressively enhance for larger screens.
   
   HOW: Media queries detect viewport width and apply different styles at
   specific breakpoints (768px for tablets, 1024px for desktops).
   
   RESULT: A fluid, adaptive design that works beautifully on all devices.
