   RESET.CSS - Browser Normalization
   
   WHY: Different browsers apply different default styles (margins, padding, 
   font sizes) to HTML elements. This creates inconsistencies where a page 
   looks different in Chrome vs Firefox vs Safari.
   
   HOW: We explicitly reset all common elements to have zero margin/padding
   and consistent box-sizing, giving us a clean slate to build upon.
   
   RESULT: Consistent appearance across all browsers, and we control exactly
   how much spacing each element has.
   ============================================================================ */

/* WHY: We use the universal selector (*) to target every element on the page,
   including pseudo-elements (::before, ::after). This ensures no element has
   unexpected default spacing.
   
   HOW: The asterisk selector has low specificity, so our specific styles will
   easily override these defaults.
   
   RESULT: A truly blank canvas with no margin or padding anywhere. */

*::after {
  margin: 0;

  /* WHY: border-box makes width/height calculations intuitive. Without it,
     padding and borders ADD to the declared width, causing layout surprises.
     
     HOW: With border-box, if we say width: 300px with 20px padding, the total
     width stays 300px (content shrinks to 260px to accommodate padding).
     
     RESULT: Predictable sizing where width means total width, not just content. */
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* WHY: HTML and body are the foundation of our page. Setting their height to 
   100% allows child elements (like full-screen hero sections) to calculate
   their own 100vh heights correctly.
   
   HOW: Percentages in CSS are relative to the parent. By ensuring html and body
   are full height, children can use percentage-based heights.
   
   RESULT: Full-screen layouts work properly without weird spacing issues. */
html,
body {
  height: 100%;
  /* WHY: We set the line-height to 1.6 instead of the browser default (usually 1.2)
     because it improves readability by adding more vertical space between lines.
     
     HOW: Line-height is unitless (no px or %), which means it scales proportionally
     with font-size. A value of 1.6 means 160% of the font size.
     
     RESULT: Text is easier to read, especially in paragraphs and longer content. */
  line-height: 1.6;
}

/* WHY: Browsers add bullets and extra left padding to lists by default, which
   often conflicts with navigation menus and custom list designs.
   
   HOW: We remove list-style (bullets/numbers) and set margin/padding to zero.
   
   RESULT: Lists start as blank slates, perfect for navigation menus where we
   want full control over styling. */

/* WHY: Links have default underlines and colors (usually blue/purple) that
   rarely match our design. We need to override these.
   
   HOW: text-decoration removes underlines, and "inherit" for color makes links
   use their parent's text color instead of the browser's default blue.
   
   RESULT: Links look like normal text until we explicitly style them. */

/* WHY: Images are inline elements by default, which can cause unexpected extra
   space below them (from line-height). Also, large images can overflow containers.
   
   HOW: display: block removes inline spacing issues, and max-width: 100% ensures
   images never exceed their container's width while maintaining aspect ratio.
   
   RESULT: Images behave predictably and responsively, shrinking on small screens. */

/* WHY: Buttons and inputs inherit font properties inconsistently across browsers.
   Safari, Chrome, and Firefox all handle form elements differently.

   their parent, ensuring consistency.
   
   RESULT: Form elements look cohesive with the rest of the design. */

   HOW: Setting background, border, and cursor resets the button to a neutral state.
   
   RESULT: Buttons start as blank rectangles that we can style to match our theme. */

/* WHY: OPTIMAL LINE LENGTH + PERFECT CENTERING - Typography research shows that
   the ideal line length for comfortable reading is 65-75 characters. We also
   center the paragraph block within its container for visual balance.
   
   UX PRINCIPLE: Readers lose their place on lines longer than 75 characters.
   Additionally, centered text blocks create visual harmony and draw the eye
   naturally to the content.
   
   HOW: max-width: 70ch (reduced from 75ch for slightly tighter, more comfortable
   reading). margin-inline: auto centers the paragraph block horizontally within
   its parent container.
   
   RESULT: Perfectly centered, comfortable paragraphs with optimal line length
   that create natural white space on both sides, preventing text from stretching
   and ensuring the Floating Dock never obstructs content. */
p {
  max-width: 70ch; /* Optimal reading width: 65-70 characters */
  margin-inline: auto; /* CRITICAL: Centers the paragraph block horizontally */
}

/* WHY: HEADING CENTERING - Section headings (h2, h3) should also be centered
   within their containers and constrained to reasonable widths for visual balance.
   
   UX PRINCIPLE: Centered headings create clear visual hierarchy and guide the
   eye through the content structure. They also prevent headings from becoming
   uncomfortably wide on large screens.
   
   HOW: max-width constrains heading width. margin-inline: auto centers them
   horizontally. We use slightly different max-widths based on typical heading
   lengths (headings are usually shorter than paragraphs).
   
   RESULT: Perfectly centered, balanced headings that create visual hierarchy
   and maintain readability across all screen sizes. */
