/* ============================================================================
   HERO.CSS - Full-Screen Hero Section
   
   WHY: The hero section is the first thing visitors see. It needs to make an
   immediate impact by filling the entire screen (100vh), displaying a stunning
   background image, and presenting the core message clearly.
   
   HOW: We use viewport height units (vh), background-size: cover for the image,
   and flexbox for content centering.
   
   RESULT: A dramatic, immersive introduction that works on all screen sizes.
   ============================================================================ */

/* WHY: The hero section must fill the entire viewport height (100vh) to create
   that "wow" moment when the page loads - no scrolling needed to see the key message.
   
   HOW: height: 100vh means "100% of the viewport height". On a 1080px tall screen,
   this is 1080px. On a phone (800px tall), it's 800px. Always fills the screen.
   
   RESULT: The hero section perfectly fills the visible area on any device, from
   phones to 4K monitors. */
.hero {
  height: 100vh;
  /* WHY: position: relative establishes a positioning context for the absolutely
     positioned header (which overlays this section) and for the dark overlay.
     
     HOW: Child elements with position: absolute will be positioned relative to
     this hero section, not the entire page.
     
     RESULT: The header and overlay stay properly aligned with the hero section. */
  position: relative;
  
  /* WHY: We use flexbox to center the hero content (title, tagline, button) both
     horizontally and vertically in the middle of the screen.
     
     HOW: display: flex activates flexbox. justify-content: center centers along
     the horizontal axis, and align-items: center does the same vertically.
     
     RESULT: Content is perfectly centered regardless of how much content there is. */
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  
  /* WHY: We add padding to prevent content from touching the screen edges on mobile,
     especially in cases where notches or rounded corners might cut off content.
     
     HOW: Padding creates an inner cushion. Even if the content is centered, this
     ensures text doesn't get too close to edges.
     
     RESULT: Safe, readable content on all devices, including iPhone notches. */
  padding: var(--spacing-md);
  
  /* WHY: The background image creates the visual foundation of the hero section.
     We set it on the hero itself so it can be easily changed in HTML or via JavaScript.
     
     HOW: background properties control how the image is displayed, positioned, and sized.
     
     RESULT: A beautiful, scalable background that adapts to any screen size. */
  background-position: center center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  /* WHY: background-size: cover ensures the image always fills the entire hero
     section, maintaining aspect ratio. The image scales up or down as needed.
     
     HOW: "cover" means "scale the image to cover the entire container, even if
     some parts are cropped". The alternative, "contain", would show the entire
     image but might leave gaps.
     
     RESULT: Edge-to-edge background with no gaps or white space, regardless of
     image dimensions or screen size. */
  background-size: cover;
  
  /* WHY: We set a fallback background color in case the image fails to load or
     while it's loading. This prevents a jarring white flash.
     
     HOW: background-color is only visible if the image is transparent or missing.
     
     RESULT: Smooth loading experience with no visual gaps. */
  background-color: var(--color-bg-primary);
  
  /* WHY: Overflow: hidden prevents any child elements from extending beyond the
     hero section boundaries, keeping the layout clean.
     
     HOW: Any content that would extend past the edges is clipped and hidden.
     
     RESULT: Clean edges with no unexpected overflow on smaller screens. */
  overflow: hidden;
}

/* WHY: The hero content needs to be layered on top of the background image AND
   above the dark overlay (which improves text readability).
   
   HOW: position: relative with z-index: 10 ensures the content stays above the
   overlay (which has z-index: 5).
   
   RESULT: Text and buttons remain clearly visible and interactive. */
.hero-content {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 10;
  text-align: center;
  /* WHY: We constrain the content width so that on ultra-wide screens, the text
     doesn't stretch too wide, which hurts readability.
     
     HOW: max-width: 800px limits the content area, while width: 100% allows it
     to shrink on smaller screens.
     
     RESULT: Optimal reading width (50-75 characters per line) on all screen sizes. */
  max-width: 800px;
  width: 100%;
}

/* WHY: A dark overlay between the background image and text ensures text remains
   readable regardless of the image's colors. Light images can make white text
   invisible without this.
   
   HOW: We use a pseudo-element (::before) to create a semi-transparent black layer.
   position: absolute with inset: 0 makes it cover the entire hero section.
   
   RESULT: Text is always readable, even if the background image changes. */
.hero::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  /* WHY: inset: 0 is shorthand for top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0, left: 0. This makes
     the overlay cover the entire hero section.
     
     HOW: The pseudo-element stretches to all four edges of its positioned parent.
     
     RESULT: Full-coverage overlay with minimal code. */
  inset: 0;
  /* WHY: rgba(5, 10, 20, 0.6) creates a semi-transparent version of our primary
     background color (60% opacity). This darkens the image while letting it show through.
     
     HOW: RGBA adds an alpha channel (transparency) to RGB colors. 0.6 = 60% opaque.
     
     RESULT: The background image is visible but darkened, creating the perfect
     contrast for white text. */
  background-color: rgba(5, 10, 20, 0.6);
  /* WHY: z-index: 5 places the overlay above the background image (z-index: 1)
     but below the content (z-index: 10).
     
     HOW: CSS stacks elements by z-index value within the same stacking context.
     
     RESULT: Proper layering: background < overlay < content. */

/* WHY: The hero title is the most important text on the page. It must be large,
   bold, and immediately grab attention.
   
   HOW: We use our largest font size (48px), bold weight, and generous line-height

   RESULT: A commanding title that dominates the hero section. */
.hero-title {
  font-size: var(--font-size-2xl);
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold);
  /* WHY: line-height: 1.2 (120% of font size) keeps the title compact while
     maintaining readability. Titles can use tighter line-height than body text.

     RESULT: Visually powerful title with optimal spacing. */

  /* WHY: Letter-spacing adds space between letters, creating an elegant, luxurious
     feel. It's particularly effective with uppercase text.
     
     HOW: 0.05em = 5% of the font size. At 48px, this adds ~2.4px between letters.
     
     RESULT: The title feels premium and is easier to read at large sizes. */
  letter-spacing: 0.05em;
  
  /* WHY: A subtle text shadow adds depth and improves readability if the overlay
     isn't dark enough in certain areas.
     
     HOW: We create a soft black shadow (rgba) that's offset 2px down and 4px to
     the right with a 10px blur.
     
     RESULT: Text "pops" off the background, ensuring readability. */
  text-shadow: 2px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);

/* WHY: The tagline supports the main title with additional context. It should be
   visible but less prominent than the title.

     RESULT: The button feels distinct and important, not cramped next to the text. */
  margin-bottom: var(--spacing-xl);

     RESULT: Easy-to-read supporting text that complements the title. */
  line-height: 1.6;
  
  /* WHY: Max-width: 600px constrains the tagline to an even narrower width than
     the overall hero-content (800px), creating visual variety.
