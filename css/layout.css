   LAYOUT.CSS - Structural Foundation with CSS Grid & Flexbox
   
   WHY: This file establishes the fundamental page structure and reusable layout
   utilities. By separating layout logic from visual styling, we can change
   colors/fonts without breaking the structure.
   
   HOW: We use CSS Grid for the overall page layout (header, main, footer) and
   Flexbox for component-level alignment (centering, distribution).
   
   RESULT: A robust, flexible foundation that adapts to content changes.
   ============================================================================ */

/* WHY: The body is the root container for all visible content. Setting specific
   font and color properties here ensures consistency across the entire page.
   
   HOW: All child elements inherit these values unless explicitly overridden.
   We're establishing our baseline typography and color scheme.
   
   RESULT: Every text element defaults to white text on a dark background with
   the system font stack, creating immediate consistency. */

  background-color: var(--color-bg-primary);
  color: var(--color-text-main);
  font-size: var(--font-size-base);

  /* WHY: We disable text selection on the body to prevent awkward blue highlights
     when users accidentally drag across navigation or UI elements. However, actual
     content areas (like paragraphs) should re-enable this.
     
     HOW: user-select: none prevents the cursor from selecting text.
     
     RESULT: Cleaner UI interaction, though we'll re-enable selection for readable
     content sections. */

/* WHY: Main content areas should allow text selection for copying important info.
   We override the body's user-select: none specifically for main content.

/* ============================================================================
   CONTAINER SYSTEM
   
   WHY: Wide screens (like 27" monitors) make reading uncomfortable if text
   stretches across the entire width. Optimal line length is 50-75 characters.
   
   HOW: We create container classes that constrain content width and center it.
   ============================================================================ */

/* WHY: PERFECT CENTERING with Floating Dock Awareness - The container must be
   centered while also creating a safe zone for the Floating Glass Dock on the right.
   
   DESIGN STRATEGY: Instead of asymmetric padding (which breaks centering), we use
   a narrower max-width (1100px instead of 1200px) and perfect centering. This
   creates natural breathing room on both sides, ensuring the dock floats over
   white space without obstructing content.
   
   HOW: margin-inline: auto (modern CSS) centers the container perfectly. max-width
   constrains content width. Width 90% ensures mobile spacing.
   
   RESULT: Symmetrically centered content with equal spacing on both sides, and
   enough right-side space for the Floating Glass Dock to hover comfortably. */
.container {
  /* WHY: width: 90% ensures content doesn't touch screen edges on mobile devices
     while being responsive to different viewport sizes.
     
     HOW: 90% width leaves 5% breathing room on each side on small screens.
     
     RESULT: Content has comfortable spacing on all devices. */
  width: 90%;
  
  /* WHY: max-width: 1100px (reduced from 1200px) ensures content stays within
     a readable width while creating natural space for the Floating Glass Dock.
     
     STRATEGIC CALCULATION: 1100px content + dock (60px collapsed / 280px expanded)
     + spacing = perfect balance on typical screens (1366px, 1440px, 1920px).
     
     HOW: Max-width prevents content from exceeding this value even if viewport
     is wider.
     
     RESULT: Content never becomes uncomfortably wide, and the dock always has
     space to float without obstruction. */
  max-width: 1100px;
  
  /* WHY: margin-inline: auto is THE CRITICAL PROPERTY for horizontal centering.
     It's the modern CSS way to center block elements (equivalent to margin: 0 auto).
     
     HOW: "inline" refers to the horizontal axis. "auto" on both sides distributes
     remaining space equally, achieving perfect centering.
     
     RESULT: The container is perfectly centered with equal spacing on left and
     right, creating visual balance and harmony. */
  margin-inline: auto;
  
  /* WHY: Minimal uniform padding prevents content from touching edges while
     maintaining centering. We use small padding instead of large asymmetric
     padding to preserve balance.
     
     HOW: var(--spacing-md) applies 24px padding on both sides equally.
     
     RESULT: Content has breathing room without breaking the centered layout. */

  padding-right: var(--spacing-md);

/* WHY: Some sections need to span the full width (like full-bleed images or
   background colors) even if their content is contained.
   
   HOW: width: 100% explicitly makes the element fill its parent container.
   
   RESULT: Full-width sections for dramatic visual impact. */

   FLEXBOX UTILITIES
   
   WHY: Flexbox is the most efficient way to align items in a single direction
   (horizontally or vertically). These utility classes eliminate repetitive code.
   
   HOW: We create reusable classes that apply common flexbox patterns.
   ============================================================================ */

/* WHY: Centering content (both horizontally and vertically) is extremely common
   in web design - hero sections, cards, modals, etc.
   
   HOW: display: flex activates flexbox. justify-content: center centers children
   along the main axis (horizontal by default), and align-items: center does the
   same for the cross axis (vertical).
   
   RESULT: Perfect centering with just one class, no margin calculations needed. */
.flex-center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

/* WHY: Navigation bars typically have content split between left and right
   (logo on left, menu on right).
   
   HOW: space-between distributes children so the first item is at the start,
   the last item is at the end, and remaining space is evenly distributed between.
   
   RESULT: Automatic spacing that adapts to content size - perfect for headers. */
.flex-between {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

/* WHY: Sometimes we want items evenly spaced with space on the sides too,
   like a set of evenly distributed buttons.
   
   HOW: space-around gives each item equal space on both sides, creating even
   distribution including the edges.
   
   RESULT: Visually balanced spacing across the entire container. */
.flex-around {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
  align-items: center;

/* WHY: Vertical layouts (like sidebars or stacked cards) need flex-direction: column.
   Without this, flex defaults to horizontal row layout.

   CSS GRID UTILITIES
   
   WHY: CSS Grid is superior for two-dimensional layouts (rows AND columns
   simultaneously). It's perfect for overall page structure.
   
   HOW: We define grid templates that create predictable layouts.
   ============================================================================ */

/* WHY: A standard 12-column grid provides flexibility for complex layouts while
   maintaining alignment. It's divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6, making it versatile.
   
   HOW: repeat(12, 1fr) creates 12 equal-width columns. "fr" stands for "fraction"
   and distributes available space proportionally.
   
   RESULT: A flexible grid that can accommodate any layout combination (6+6 columns,
   4+4+4, 3+3+3+3, etc.). */

/* WHY: Many layouts need equal columns (like a 3-column feature section).
   
   HOW: repeat(3, 1fr) creates 3 columns of equal width. auto-fit allows columns
   to wrap to the next row if the container is too narrow.
   
   RESULT: Responsive columns that automatically adjust to available space. */

   POSITIONING & Z-INDEX
   
   WHY: Certain elements (navigation, sidebar) need to stay in place while the
   user scrolls. We also need a clear stacking order for overlapping elements.
   ============================================================================ */

/* WHY: Headers typically need to stay visible while scrolling (sticky navigation),
   but for this design we want it to overlay the hero image.
   
   HOW: position: relative establishes a positioning context for absolute children.
   z-index ensures the header stays on top of other content.
   
   RESULT: The header provides a reference point for absolutely positioned children
   and maintains proper stacking order. */
.relative {
  position: relative;

/* WHY: Fixed elements stay in the same position relative to the viewport, even
   when scrolling. This is essential for sidebars and sticky navigation.

   it relative to the viewport.

/* WHY: Vertical spacing between sections is crucial for visual rhythm. Different
   section types need different spacing amounts.

   scale variables for consistency.

   VISIBILITY UTILITIES
   
   WHY: Responsive design often requires hiding elements at certain screen sizes.

   RESULT: Clean conditional visibility without JavaScript.
   ============================================================================ */

/* WHY: Sometimes we need to hide content visually but keep it accessible to
   screen readers (like icon labels or skip navigation links).
